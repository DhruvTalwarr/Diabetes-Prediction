Diabetes Detection System

This project is a supervised machine learning system built to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (diabetes.csv).

📌 Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more to determine the risk of diabetes using classification algorithms.
